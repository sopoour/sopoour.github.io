# Personal Website

I've started this website as one of my first coding projects. It's regularly updated and serves as a more detailed CV/Resume as well as Portfolio of my upcoming projects.

Besides coding this website, I also designed all of it myself. It's mainly coded in HTML & CSS as well as some Javascript for UI animations.
